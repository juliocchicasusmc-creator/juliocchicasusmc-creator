🌱 I’m currently learning system administration, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity practices, building hands-on labs with Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and GitHub projects to showcase my progress.

🔭 I’m currently working on earning Security+, Linux+, and Splunk certifications while applying my knowledge through real-world-inspired GitHub projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m fluent in both English and Spanish and have worked in multicultural environments worldwide.
